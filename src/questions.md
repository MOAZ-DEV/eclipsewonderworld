1-	Solar eclipse: A solar eclipse is a rare celestial event causing darkness on Earth when the Moon passes between the Earth and the Sun, blocking out the Sun's light.
2-	Lunar eclipse: Lunar eclipse is a celestial event that occurs when the Earth's shadow falls on the Moon, causing the Moon to appear red or orange.
3-	Total solar eclipse: A total solar eclipse is a celestial event where the Moon completely covers the Sun from Earth, obscuring its light and revealing the Sun's corona.
4-	Annular solar eclipse: An annular solar eclipse is a rare celestial event where the Moon passes in front of the Sun, but does not fully cover it, creating a ring-like effect around the shadow of the Moon.
5-	Partial solar eclipse: A partial solar eclipse is a rare celestial event where the Moon partially obscures the Sun, creating a dark shadow or silhouette on the Sun's surface.
6-	Hybrid solar eclipse: A hybrid solar eclipse is a rare astronomical event where the Moon's umbral and penumbral shadows create different zones, including the central zone where the Moon completely obscures the Sun, the penumbra zone where the Moon partially obscures the Sun, and the antumbra zone where the Moon partially obscures the Sun. This creates a unique and impressive astronomical event, providing an opportunity for observers to explore the science behind solar eclipses.
7-	Penumbral lunar eclipse: A penumbral eclipse is a rare celestial event where the Moon passes through the outer shadow of the Earth, creating a partially obscured Sun.
8-	Partial lunar eclipse: A partial lunar eclipse is a rare celestial event where the Earth's shadow partially obscures the Moon, creating a partially obscured Moon during an eclipse.
9-	Total lunar eclipse: A total lunar eclipse is a rare celestial event where the Moon completely enters the Earth's shadow, creating a dark-red or brownish color on the Moon due to the Earth's atmosphere.
